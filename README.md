Hi all .. i have written a programme for a game of rock papers and scissor using python.
i hope all of you know the game rules ..if u dont know the rules it is as shown below..
Game rules-> rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper,paper beats rock.
so for example if player 1 chooses rock and player two chooses scissors then player 1 wins..
so in the program there will be two players and each players can input there name and also they can choose their preference of properties(rock ,paper or scissors)
and after the programme shows the winner the player can choose whether to quit or continue..
Now enjoy the game!!!
